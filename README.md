## Description
This application uses the Handlebars MVC to create the front and backend of a tech blog.

## Installation
To install, clone the repo from Github. First scource the schema by loading into mySQL and running "source db/schema.sql" then quit. To seed the files, run "node seeds/index.js" in the terminal.
After all that is done run "npm i && npm start" to install the necessary files and start the server.

## Usage
Once the page is loaded, you'll have to click on the login tab. Once there, sign up for an account and login that way. Once signed up, you'll be able to creat your first blog post. I didn't finish the app but once you submit the blog post it'll be rendered onto the dashboard page along with other blog posts by other users.
